#Magic Mirror
Previously, I had worked with the rasberrypi to create an retro bartop arcade.
After making it I still had an itch to make something else with the powerful little computer.
I found that the magic mirror was one of the most popular projects with the raspberrypi.
Below is an example of what it looks like when turned on.

UPDATE

I recently re-painted the magic mirror and added a motion sensor to the mirror.
